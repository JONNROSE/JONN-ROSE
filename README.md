Best to help other in unlocking iCloud lock account when there been no help or way to remove iCloud 
Account from a iPhone you have paid for apple don't help because the person or retail place has sold 
A iPhone that lock to previous owner and you can't contact them  so there must be a few amazing people
to help if we all work together and we can learn a way that will remove iCloud lock account and we will 
start Up a program to help people..
